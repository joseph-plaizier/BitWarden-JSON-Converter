# BitWarden-JSON-Converter
A C# Form that converts a BitWarden vault JSON export to a report that can be printed.  This is a side project for myself and is still in progress.  I am a student learning the basics of C# at the moment and thought this kind of project would help me stretch a little more.

## Requirements
+ .NET 8.0
+ An exported BitWarden JSON file (not encrypted)

## How to Install/Run
There are two options for downloading and running this project.  Both require downloading a copy of the repository.  
* If you are using Git then you can clone a copy of the repository.  If you aren't using Git, you can click the Green **Code** button and click **Download Zip**.
* If you have Visual Studio installed or another similar code editor, you can load the project directly and run it from there.  If you don't have Visual Studio, you can navigate to *BitWarden JSON/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/publish/BitWarden JSON.exe*

## How to Use the Application
* When the application is run it will first prompt for a BitWarden .json file.  You can type in the path to the file or browse to it.
